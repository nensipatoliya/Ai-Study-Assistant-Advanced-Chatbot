Student Study Notes - AI & ML Basics

Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial
Intelligence that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make
predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Common
types include Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and
Reinforcement Learning.

Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that
uses Neural Networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns. It
is widely used in image recognition, speech recognition, and autonomous
systems.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is a field of AI that helps
computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. It is used
in chatbots, translation systems, sentiment analysis, and voice
assistants.

Computer Vision: Computer Vision enables computers to understand and
interpret visual data like images and videos. It is used in face
recognition, object detection, medical imaging, and self-driving cars.

Large Language Models (LLM): LLMs are advanced AI models trained on
large text datasets. They can understand context, generate text, answer
questions, and help in coding and learning tasks.

Generative AI: Generative AI creates new content such as text, images,
audio, and video. Examples include AI text generators, image generators,
and code generation tools.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG is an AI technique that
combines searching external knowledge sources with generative AI. It
improves accuracy by retrieving relevant information before generating
answers.
